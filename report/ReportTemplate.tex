Rankmaniac Report

\section{Overview}
During this RankManiac project, our group ``churn'' implemented PageRank on the given network via Map Reduce through Hadoop on Amazon AWS Clusters. Two sample datasets, ``GNPn100p05'' and ``EmailEnron'', were distributed to us for the purpose of local testing. Our Rankmaniac score was determined by our PageRank's elapsed time and the correctness on a larger, hidden dataset on these Amazon AWS clusters. This report's purpose is to illustrate the process for our implementation of PageRank.

\section{Initial Framework}
\subsection*{Development}
The data that was given to us was in the form: 
{
\begin{center}
NodeId:[NODEID] \hspace{4mm} [CURRENT\_RANK],[PREVIOUS\_RANK],[ADJACENCY\_LIST]
\end{center}
}
\noindent After a basic understanding of the structure of the project, our initial framework of MapReduce was as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textsc{PageRank\_Map}: \\
        The input of this mapping will either be in the above format, or the output of \textsc{Process\_Reduce}, which prepends a [ITERATION] value in front of the current values. This mapping function will take in the key/value pair, increment [ITERATION] by 1, and 
        \item \textsc{PageRank\_Reduce}: 
        \item \textsc{Process\_Map}:
        \item \textsc{Process\_Reduce}:
    \end{itemize}

\subsection*{Problems}

\section{Refactored Framework}
\subsection*{Refactoring}
 % Talk about results in here too.

\subsection*{Optimizations}
 % Talk about results in here too (15 iterations instead of 50)
 % (Low level stuff).

\section{Testing}
 % Can talk about data mining. What scripts we used. etc.

\section{Contributions}
 % Should be on FB chat.
